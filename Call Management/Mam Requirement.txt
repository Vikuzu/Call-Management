Singleton design patterns     
Create a class "Globals" in separate globals.h file         
- will have all static members         
- getter static method to get value of static variable         
- All constants that are required in the project         
- constant = string PROJECT_DIR = "/home/shailaja/project1"         
- NAME_MAX_SIZE = 25     
Globals::PROJECT_DIR     
Globals::NAME_MAX_SIZE
-------------------------------------------------
Read data from files into STL before displaying main menu
CRUD opertions will be done on STL (vectors, link, hash map)
Overwrite data into same files
-------------------------------------------------
At least 2 levels of menus

There need not be 1-to-1 correspondance between text files and STL
